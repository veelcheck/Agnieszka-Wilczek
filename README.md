# My first landing :airplane: page (possibly not the last one)
 
I need practice so I decided to combine what I think I need (website) with what I surely need (coding, coding, coding).

## Am I happy with it? :grinning:

I sure am. It is by no means a perfect project but I made it to look like I wanted it to - overcoming arising obstacles.

## What's next? :interrobang:

It is a challenge for a beginner programmer to grasp all it takes to write a clean and good quality code. I want to get there in the end, learing a lot along the way. Like Markdown that I am trying out now. Every little thing counts :gem:.
